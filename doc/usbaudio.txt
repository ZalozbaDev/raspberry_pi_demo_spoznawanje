USB audio support:

- check 50Hz noise --> might need to supply extra grounding for Pi
- install ALSA plugins ("apt install libasound2-plugins") to have sample rate conversion support available
  - USB sound cards sometimes support 48kHz and 44.1kHz only, we need 16kHz
- tweak container's /etc/asound.conf

pcm.ac108 {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "plughw:1,0" <--- depending on which index your card appears at
}
